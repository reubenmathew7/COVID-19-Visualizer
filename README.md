# COVID-19 Data Visualizer Using MATLAB

## Requirements

You can run the app by donwloading it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NExBhQoJnuxEu_7NQxTKIpjpRw4xpcT2/view?usp=sharing). Alternatively, you can also install MATLAB on your system and run the MATLAB App file.

## Why I Built This Project

The motivation behind this project was to:
- Strengthen my **MATLAB programming** skills.
- Gain experience in handling real-world datasets.
- Build tools that could be useful in my **engineering and robotics journey**, where data visualization plays a critical role.

### Objectives:
1. **Enhance MATLAB Proficiency**: Explore MATLABâ€™s capabilities for app design, data processing, and interactive visualizations.
2. **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyze global COVID-19 trends to derive actionable insights.
3. **Interdisciplinary Learning**: Apply programming to solve challenges at the intersection of public health, engineering, and data science.

## Features

This application provides the following functionalities:

- **Data Processing**:
  - Handles raw COVID-19 datasets (e.g., daily cases, deaths, recoveries).
  - Supports global and country-specific data analysis.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - **Bar Charts**: For daily or cumulative cases/deaths.
  - **Line Graphs**: Trends over time.
  - **Dual-Axis Charts**: Compare cases and deaths simultaneously.
  
- **Customizable Filters**:
  - Select specific countries or regions.
  - Adjust date ranges using interactive date pickers.
  - Toggle between daily or cumulative data views.
  - Smooth data with an adjustable moving average slider.

- **Export Options**:
  - Save visualizations as image files for reports or presentations.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**:
   - The app processes a preloaded dataset, which contains global COVID-19 statistics sourced from Johns Hopkins University.

2. **Interactive Interface**:
   - Users can filter countries, states/regions, and time periods via dropdowns and date pickers.
   - Toggle between daily/cumulative views or cases/deaths using radio buttons.

3. **Dynamic Visualization**:
   - The app dynamically updates plots based on user selections, providing clear insights into trends and comparisons.

4. **Customization Options**:
   - A slider allows users to apply a moving average to smooth fluctuations in the data.

5. **Reset Functionality**:
   - Easily reset filters to default settings with a single button click.

## Results

The app generates meaningful insights through intuitive visualizations:

1. **Daily Trends**: Bar charts show fluctuations in daily cases or deaths.
2. **Cumulative Data**: Line graphs illustrate long-term trends of cases or deaths globally or by region.
3. **Comparison Charts**: Dual-axis plots allow simultaneous analysis of cases and deaths over time.

These visualizations can be exported for use in presentations or further analysis.
